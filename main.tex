This research paper aims to analyze the Airbnb dataset, focusing on various factors that influence prices of listings. 
The dataset encompasses key features such as price, room type, person capacity, host characteristics, cleanliness rating, and geographical attributes. 
The study poses the research question: "What are the factors that influence the price and location of Airbnb listings?" 
The author postulates that the pricing is significantly influenced by the distance from the center.

\section{Introduction}
The rise of Airbnb~\cite{andreu2020airbnb} has transformed the hospitality industry, allowing individuals to rent accommodations. 
Understanding the determinants of pricing and location is crucial for both hosts and guests. 
This paper explores the dataset to uncover insights into the factors shaping Airbnb prices and locations.

\section{Dataset Description}
The Airbnb dataset consists of several columns, including price, room type, person capacity, host characteristics, cleanliness rating, and geographical attributes \cite{bathwal2024flightprice}. 
These variables provide a comprehensive view of the listings and their characteristics.

The mean, the median, minimum (min), the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles and maximum (max) are calculated for each variable shown in the table.

\section{Research Questions}
The primary research question addressed in this study is: "What are the factors that influence the price and location of Airbnb listings?" 
This overarching question will guide the exploration of various aspects within the dataset.

\lipsum[2]

This study aims to explore the patterns and relationships within the Los Angeles Airbnb dataset. Specifically, it seeks to address the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ\_1}: What patterns exist in the data regarding property types, pricing, and availability across different neighborhoods in Los Angeles?
    \item \textbf{RQ\_2}: How do key variables such as price and property location interact to influence occupancy rates?
    \item \textbf{RQ\_3}: What factors most significantly impact customer ratings and reviews, and how do they correlate with host behavior or property characteristics?
\end{itemize}

\lipsum[3]

\section{Research Hypotheses}
Based on initial observations, a hypothesis is proposed that the distance from the city center significantly influences Airbnb pricing. 
It is hypothesized that listings closer to the center command higher prices due to factors such as proximity to attractions, events, and better infrastructure.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RH\_1\_0}: There are no significant patterns in the data regarding property types, pricing, and availability across different neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  
  \item \textbf{RH\_1\_A}: Significant patterns exist in the data regarding property types, pricing, and availability across different neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  

  \item \textbf{RH\_2\_0}: There is no significant interaction between key variables such as price and property location in influencing occupancy rates.  
  \item \textbf{RH\_2\_A}: Key variables such as price and property location significantly interact to influence occupancy rates.  

  \item \textbf{RH\_3\_0}: Factors such as customer ratings and reviews are not significantly correlated with host behavior or property characteristics.  
  \item \textbf{RH\_3\_A}: Factors such as customer ratings and reviews are significantly correlated with host behavior or property characteristics.  
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
The discussion section will delve into the findings related to the research questions and hypotheses. 
It will explore the correlation between distance from the center and pricing, considering potential confounding variables. 
Additionally, it will analyze how other variables such as room type, host superhost status, and cleanliness rating impact pricing and location.
